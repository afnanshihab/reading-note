are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.

A great way to get started with charts is with Chart.js, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.

To see how to use chart.js we’re going to create a set of 3 graphs; one will show the number of buyers a fictional product has over the course of 6 months, this will be a line chart; the second will show which countries the customers come from, this will be the pie chart; finally we’ll use a bar chart to show profit over the period.

The first thing we need to do is download Chart.js. Copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory you’ll be working in.

At first sight a <canvas> looks like the <img> element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes.
The <canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height.
The canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high.
The <canvas> element can be styled just like any normal image (margin, border, background…).
Before we can start drawing, we need to talk about the canvas grid or coordinate space.

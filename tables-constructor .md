# Basic Table Structure

The <table> element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row. <tr> You indicate the start of each row using the opening <tr> tag. (The tr stands for table row.) It is followed by one or more td elements (one for each cell in that row). At the end of the row you use a closing /tr tag. td Each cell of a table is represented using a <td> element. (The td stands for table data.) At the end of each cell you use a closing /td tag.

**Table Headings  <th>**
The th element is used just like the td element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row
The <th> element is used just like the <td> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row.


**Spanning ColumnS :**
The colspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across.

**spanning rows :**
The rowspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table.

# Javascript Constructor : 
object constructor is create a blank object and you can then add properties and method to that object.


**  Object Literals **
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

** Functions**: A function is a block of code written to perform some specific set of tasks. We can define a function using the function keyword, followed by Name and optional parameters. Body of function is enclosed in Curly braces.
* we can create new object using a combination of the new keyword and the object() constructor function.


*  ***this***  
The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects. Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers to one object, usually the object in which the function operates.

# Domain Modeling
Domain model is a structured visual representation of interconnected concepts or real world objects that incorporates vocabulary, key concepts, behavior, and relationships of all of its entities, and it mainly focuses on the visual aspect since our brains are better at memorizing and learning things using imaginetive constructs.

In coding, it is more like thinking of what you build from functions to objects as if they are things that exist in real life, and you start to better connect them and understand how they unteract with each other.

# ***A JavaScript function***


![FUNCTIONS](https://miro.medium.com/max/4000/1*fqcYje1plRJWcIggILyuow.png)

 is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.


* JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

* JavaScript Function Syntax
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

* Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

* The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

### **Function Invocation**
The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

1. When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
2. When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
3. Automatically (self invoked)

### *** Function Return***

When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.




### ***Why Functions?***
1. You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

2. You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.

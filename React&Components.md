# Introduction to React and Components
## Component Based rchitecture
***What is a component?***

A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.

***Views of a Component***

*1. Object-oriented view:*
  A component is viewed as a set of one or more cooperating classe.

*2.Conventional view:*  It is viewed as a functional element or a module of a program that integrates the processing logic.

*3.Process-related view:*  In this view, instead of creating each component from scratch.

***charactistics of a component***

1. Reusability − reused in different situations

2. Replaceable − freely substituted with other similar components.

3. Not context specific − operate in different environments and contexts.

4. Extensible − can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

5. Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces

6. Independent − designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

### Props :
“Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

***Using Props in React***

1.  define an attribute and its value(data)

2.  pass it to child component(s) by using Props

3.  render the Props Data

Introduction to React and Components
Component Based rchitecture
What is a component?
A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.

Views of a Component

Object-oriented view:A component is viewed as a set of one or more cooperating classe.
Conventional view:It is viewed as a functional element or a module of a program that integrates the processing logic
Process-related view: In this view, instead of creating each component from scratch.

charactistics of a component
Reusability − reused in different situations

Replaceable −. freely substituted with other similar components.

Not context specific − operate in different environments and contexts.

Extensible − can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces

Independent − designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.




Props :
“Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

Using Props in React
1- define an attribute and its value(data)

2- pass it to child component(s) by using Props

3- render the Props Data

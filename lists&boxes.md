# Lists 
There are three types of HTML lists:

* **Ordered Lists**
1. ***<ol>***
The ordered list is created with
the <ol> element.

2. ***<li>***
Each item in the list is placed
between an opening <li> tag
and a closing </li> tag. 

* **Unordered Lists**
1. ***<ul>***
The unordered list is created
with the <ul> element
2. ***<li>***
Each item in the list is placed
between an opening <li> tag
and a closing </li> tag.
  

  *EXAMPLE (input and output of ordered and unordered lists)*

  **Nested Lists**

  * You can put a second list inside
an <li> element to create a sublist or nested list.

*EXAMPLE*

* **Definition Lists**
1. ***<dl>***
The definition list is created with
the <dl> element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.

2. ***<dt>***
This is used to contain the term
being defined
3. ***<dd>***
This is used to contain the
definition

# BOXES

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.

###  ***WHAT THE properties can we change in prief :***

1. Control the dimensions of your boxes
2. Create borders around boxes
3. Set margins and padding for boxes
4. Show and hide boxes


**Width, height**

 BY  using  pixels, percentages, or ems. Traditionally, pixels have
been the most popular method,,  When you use percentages,
the size of the box is relative to the size of the browser window.

**Overflow**

* hidden   : This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit inthe box.

* scroll  :
This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll
to see the missing content.


**Border, Margin & Padding**
***WHAT THE DEFFIRENCE BETWEEN Border, Margin & Padding***

* **Border**
Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to
be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.

* **Margin**
Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.Padding

* **Padding** is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents

![Border, Margin & Padding](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f6/f6/c9/f6f6c946356774ddb886956cd94df4c9.png)

**border-width**

 TO control the width of a border. The value of this property can either be given in pixels or using one of the following values:

thin / medium / thick

**border-style**

solid (a single solid line)

dotted (a series of square dots)

double (two solid lines)

dashed (a series of short lines ....etc)

**padding**

The value of this property is
most often specified in pixels.

**The margin**
controls the gap between boxes. Its value is commonly given in pixels, although you may also use percentages or ems.


**display**

The display property allows you to turn an inline element into a block-level element or viceversa, and can also be used to hide an element from the page.

1. *inline*: 
((This causes a block-level
element to act like an inline
element.))
2. *block*: 
((This causes an inline element to
act like a block-level element))
3. *inline-block*: 
((This causes a block-level
element to flow like an inline
element, while retaining other
features of a block-level element.))
4. *none*:
((This hides an element from the
page))

**border-radius**
 The value indicates the size of the radius in pixels.

# **RULES FOR NAMINGVARIABLES** 

**WHAT ARE THE  rules you must always follow when giving a variable a namE**
1. The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number. 

2. The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name.

3. You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something

4. All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names

5. Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores. 

6. If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.
For example, f i rstName rather
than fi rstnarne (this is referred
to as camel case).

***ARRAYS***

(definition) An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.

## HOW TO CREATE AN ARRAY 
You create an array and give it
a name just like you would any
other variable (using the var
keyword followed by the name of
the array).

# LOGICAL OPERATORS 
* USING LOGICAL AND 

The logical AND is used to see
if the user's score is greater
than or equal to the pass mark
in both of the rounds of the test.
The result is stored in a variable
called passBoth
* USING LOGICAL OR & LOGICAL NOT

Here is the same test but this
time using the logical OR operator
to find out if the user has passed
at least one of the two rounds.
If they pass just one round, they
do not need to retake the test. , the logical
NOT will invert the result of the
Boolean variable so it is false.
It is then written into the page.


**IF STATEMENTS**

the i f statement is checking if the value currently
held in a variable is N TIMES.

* BY using if ...else statement 
Here you can see that an
if ... e 1 se statement allows you
to provide two sets of code:
1. one set if the condition
evaluates to true
2. another set if the condition is
false

***USING SWITCH STATEMENTS ***

switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match). 

There are three types of loop:

 for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.

2. Name your repository hello-world.
3. Write a short description.
4. Select Initialize this repository with a README.

GitHub does all the work to direct visitors to username.github.io to view your new website. This can take up to 10 minutes. After some time has passed, you can open a new tab in your browser to go to your site!.
## Understanding the GitHub flow

GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly. This guide explains how and why GitHub flow works.

### Create a branch

When you're working on a project, you're going to have a bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any given time – some of which are ready to go, and others which are not. Branching exists to help you manage this workflow.
 
### ProTip
* Branching is a core concept in Git, and the entire GitHub flow is based upon it. There's only one rule: anything in the main branch is always deployable.

* Because of this, it's extremely important that your new branch is created off of main when working on a feature or a fix. Your branch name should be descriptive (e.g., refactor-authentication, user-content-cache-key, make-retina-avatars), so that others can see what is being worked on.

#### Making Changes

One of the first things you can do is remove the default title of your index page, and add a friendlier message to it. Since this is a very quick change – and your first one – you’re going to make it on the default branch: main.

View the _config.yml file by navigating to it in the Code tab. You can edit the file by clicking on the pencil icon.


Currently your site has no set title, so we’re falling back to the name of the repo. To change this, I’m going to add the line “title: Welcome to the Octocat’s homepage!” to this file. Feel free to do the same, except for your own username.

Under this title, you can add a message about the purpose of the page and describe what you want people to do while they’re here. I’m going set mine to “Feel free to bookmark this to keep an eye on my project updates”

## What it means to contribute 

If you’re a new open source contributor, the process can be intimidating. How do you find the right project? What if you don’t know how to code? What if something goes wrong?

## ***Do you like planning events?***

* Organize workshops or meetups about the project, like @fzamperin did for NodeSchool
* Organize the project’s conference (if they have one)
* Help community members find the right conferences and submit proposals for speaking
## ***Do you like to design?***
* Restructure layouts to improve the project’s usability
* Conduct user research to reorganize and refine the project’s navigation or menus, like Drupal suggests
* Put together a style guide to help the project have a consistent visual design
* Create art for t-shirts or a new logo, like hapi.js’s contributors did
## ***Do you like to write?***
* Write and improve the project’s documentation
* Curate a folder of examples showing how the project is used
* Start a newsletter for the project, or curate highlights from the mailing list
* Write tutorials for the project, like PyPA’s contributors did
* Write a translation for the project’s documentation

## Orienting yourself to a new project
For anything more than a typo fix, contributing to open source is like walking up to a group of strangers at a party. If you start talking about llamas, while they were deep in a discussion about goldfish, they’ll probably look at you a little strangely.

Before jumping in blindly with your own suggestions, start by learning how to read the room. Doing so increases the chances that your ideas will be noticed and heard.

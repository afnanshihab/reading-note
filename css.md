### What is CSS ?

* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.

### What is CSS for?
* As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

* A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.

* Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.

* Three Ways to Insert CSS

*There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:*

1. External CSS
2. Internal CSS
3. Inline CSS

-----

***External CSS***

With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.

***Internal CSS***

An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.

***Inline CSS***

An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

### ***CSS color Property***

The color property specifies the color of text.

Tip: Use a background color combined with a text color that makes the text easy to read.

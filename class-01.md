 ## Duckett HTML book:
![html](https://elzero.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/learn-html4.png)
* ***Introduction*** 

  It has been written with two very
different types of people in mind:

● Those who want to learn how to design and build websites
from scratch

● Anyone who has a website (that may be built using a
content management system, blogging software, or an
e-commerce platform) and wants more control over the
appearance of their pages
The only things you need in order to use this book are a
computer with a web browser and a text editor (such as
Notepad, which comes with Windows, or TextEdit, which
comes with Macs).

* ***Structure*** (pp.12-39)

**Body, Head & Title**

***<body>***

You met the <body> element
in the first example we created.
Everything inside this element is
shown inside the main browser
window.

***<head>***

Before the <body> element you
will often see a <head> element.
This contains information
about the page (rather than
information that is shown within
the main part of the browser
window that is highlighted in
blue on the opposite page).
You will usually find a <title>
element inside the <head>
element.

***<title>***

The contents of the <title>
element are either shown in the
top of the browser, above where
you usually type in the URL of
the page you want to visit, or
on the tab for that page (if your
browser uses tabs to allow you
to view multiple pages at the
same time).

* ***Extra Markup*** (p.176-199)

Since the web was first created, there have
been several different versions of HTML.

Each new version was designed
to be an improvement on the
last (with new elements and
attributes added and older code
removed).
There have also been several
versions of each browser used to
view web pages, each of which
implements new code. Not all
web users, however, have the
latest browsers installed on
their computers, which means
that not everyone will be able to
view all of the latest features and
markup.

**Because there have been
several versions of HTML, each
web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML
the page is using (although
browsers usually display the
page even if it is not included).
We will therefore be including
one in each example for the rest
of the book.**

* <!-- -->
If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, you
can add the text between these
characters:
<!-- comment goes here -->

* <div> chapter-08/grouping-block-elements.html HTML
The <div> element allows you to
group a set of elements together
in one block-level box.

* <span>
The <span> element acts like
an inline equivalent of the <div>
element. It is used to either:
1. Contain a section of text
where there is no other suitable
element to differentiate it from
its surrounding text
2. Contain a number of inline
elements
* <iframe> chapter-08/iframes.html HTML
An iframe is like a little window
that has been cut into your
page — and in that window you
can see another page. The term
iframe is an abbreviation of inline
frame.

* ***HTML5 Layout*** 
![Layout HTML](https://data-flair.training/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/07/HTML-Layout-df.jpg)

* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
*  The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.

* ***Process & Design*** 

* It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
*  Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.

## Duckett JS book:

 ![JavaScript](https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*bcZz-qb_DNpvrNNwQBhQmQ.jpeg)

* ***Introduction***

This book explains how JavaScript can be used
in browsers to make websites more interactive,
interesting, and user-friendly. You will also learn about
jQuery because it makes writing JavaScript a lot easier. 

* ***The ABC of Programming***
* ABC is an interactive programming language and environment for personal computing, originally intended as a good replacement for BASIC. It was designed by first doing a task analysis of the programming task.

* ABC is easy to learn (an hour or so for someone who has already programmed), and yet easy to use. Originally intended as a language for beginners, it has evolved into a powerful tool for beginners and experts alike.

* Unlike BASIC, ABC is a language that offers strong support for structured programming, even better than Pascal. Refinements, for top-down stepwise program development, are an integral part of the language. Because of the powerful data-types of ABC, including tables (associative arrays), algorithms can be written at a problem-oriented level of abstraction. There is no GOTO statement in ABC, and expressions do not have side-effects.
